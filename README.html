Initial Multiple Regression Analysis of Color Values in Relation to Mean Area for Cancer Cells

Cancer	

Description

This dataset contains measurements for 167 breast biopsies diagnosed as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or benign usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH). Measurements were obtained by segmenting each biopsy into nuclei, and recording the area and color of each nuclei. Colors measured using several scales, and measurements were aggregated to the biopsy level by averaging or taking standard deviations across nuclei. The goal of this project is to explore how average nuclear area, which is known to be correlated with malignancy, is correlated with the intensity and variability of different colors in the biopsied tissue.
